		    <p>Look at the microscopic photo of few neurons and simulated 
			rendering of universes’ structure.Aren’t they remarkably symmetrical!
Wonder, do we exist inside a GIGANTIC BRAIN.The idea of the universe as a 
giant brain has been proposed by scientists and science fiction writers for 
decades. According to a study published in Nature's Scientific Reports, the 
universe may be growing in the same way as a giant brain.
This may seem weird but we often speak of the universe being a reflection 
of ourselves. Imagine if we are just a part of someone’s brain or our brain 
is itself a universe. Maybe, maybe not, but it’s fascinating to think about.

		 <p>Have you ever wondered what would happen to this universe at the 
		 end of it all? Observation expansion of the universe will continue 
		 forever. If so, the universe will cool down as it expands, eventually 
		 become too cold to sustain life. The Great glaciation theory suggest 
		 that the life after everything would be DEEP FREEZED as the universe 
		 would run out of the limited supply of energy at the very end and due 
		 to this the motion of all particles would seize. The universe will be 
		 a motionless, lifeless and frozen with no more energy to expand.

		 Xavier: Just because someone stumbles and loses their way, it doesn't 
		 mean they're lost forever. Sometimes, we all need a little help. <hr><br>
Xavier: It's the greatest gift we have: to bear their pain without breaking. 
And it comes from the most human part of us: "HOPE".<hr><br>
Xavier: Countless choices define our fate: each choice, each moment, a moment 
in the ripple of time. Enough ripple, and you change the tide…<hr>
